## Project Overview

This project uses the **Amelia II** package to perform multiple imputations on a dataset with missing values. The goal is to demonstrate how Amelia II can handle missing data and compare it with other imputation methods.

### Dataset:
- The dataset `dat0.feather` contains missing values in several columns. The Amelia II package is used to impute the missing values.

## Usage

### Private Usage

## Imputation Process

1. **Load the dataset**:
    The dataset `dat0.feather` is loaded and missing data patterns are visualized.

2. **Run Amelia II**:
    The Amelia II package performs five multiple imputations on the dataset.

3. **Compare Results**:
    Imputed values are compared against the original missing values, and the imputation performance is summarized.
